# ReadMe
This repo collects part of my experiments and practice of the go lang by google as I go through the course  [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/). 


## How to go through the repo?
Go through the main.go file and read the comments marked as *Part 1*, *Part 2:* .... The related code changes in the files are marked under the same *Part* number. In case of confusion, check the commits. 

## Report bugs or suggestions
Please use the *Issues* feature in github to raise one. There is no guarantee or promise to fix it, because, well, this repo is an experiment after all. However, all suggestions are welcome. 

## Disclaimer
Please use the code here at your own risk. As mentioned above, these are explicitly experiments, and may not always provide the expected outcome or result.
